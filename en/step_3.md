## Base of the rocket

+ Open Blender and exit the splash screen.

+ Start by selecting the cube, then press <kbd>X</kbd> to delete it.

+ Go to the Toolbox, and click on the **Create** tab. Add a cylinder.

We'll be creating the rocket from this cylinder. The cylinder will be the bottom of the rocket, and we'll add to the top of it to build up the rocket.  

+ Switch to **Edit Mode** using the menu at the bottom.
